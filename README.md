I built a simple app using custom components in React Native by following a structured approach. First, I set up the development environment by installing Expo CLI and configuring it with Android Studio. 

I started by creating a new React Native project using the command expo init MyApp. Once the project was initialized, I navigated to the project directory and launched the development server.

I focused on building custom components to maintain a clean and modular codebase. I created a components directory within the an app  folder to organize my components. The first component I built was a Header, which displayed the profile of the user. I defined this component in a file named Header.js.

From there, i built other components and combined to make the screens. I implemented navigation between screens with bottom tab navigation and rendered them in the App.js file.

Finally, I tested the app by running npm start  for Android. The app successfully displayed the screens just as the designs given.
